For it to work, you will need to have Python 2.7 installed. You can check what version of Python you have by running:\n\n\npython --version\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have Python 2.7 installed, you can install it from the \nPython website\n. \n\n\nInstall Postgres\n\n\nWallace uses Postgres to create local databases. On OS X, install Postgres from \npostgresapp.com\n. This will require downloading a zip file, unzipping the file and installing the unzipped application. \n\n\nYou will then need to add Postgres to your PATH environmental variable. If you use the default location for installing applications on OS X (namely \n/Applications\n), you can adjust your path by running the following command:\n\n\nexport PATH=\n/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin:$PATH\n\n\n\n\n\nNB: If you have installed a more recent version of Postgres (e.g., the \nthe upcoming version 9.4\n), you may need to alter that command slightly to accommodate the more recent version number. To double check which version to include, then run:    \n\n\nls /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/\n\n\n\n\nWhatever number that returns is the version number that you should place in the \nexport\n command above. If it does not return a number, you have not installed Postgres correctly in your \n/Applications\n folder or something else is horribly wrong.\n\n\nCreate the Database\n\n\nAfter installing Postgres, you will need to create a database for your experiments to use. Run the following command from the comand line:\n\n\npsql -c 'create database wallace;' -U postgres\n\n\n\n\nInstall Wallace\n\n\nInstall Wallace from the terminal by running\n\n\npip install wallace-platform\n\n\n\n\nTest that your installation works by running:\n\n\nwallace --version\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll need \naccess keys for AWS, Heroku, etc.",

Default is True.\n\n\ntask - String, the name of the experiment. Default is \"Experiment title\".\n\n\nsession - session, the experiment's connection to the database.\n\n\npractice_repeats - int, the number of practice networks (see \nNetwork.role\n). Default is 0.\n\n\nexperiment_repeats - int, the number of non practice networks (see \nNetwork.role\n). Default is 0.\n\n\nrecruiter - Recruiter, the Wallace class that recruits participants. Default is PsiTurkRecruiter.\n\n\ninitial_recruitment_size - int, the number of participants requested when the experiment first starts.

By default performs no checks and returns True.

By default returns 0.\n\n\nexperiment\n.bonus_reason\n(\nparticipant\n)\nReturn a string that will be included in an email sent to the \nparticipant\n receiving a bonus. By default it is \"Thank you for participant! Here is your bonus.\"\n\n\nexperiment\n.create_network\n()\nReturn a new network. By default, the type of network is determined by experiment.network_type(). If the experiment uses networks of different types, or needs to pass argument to the network's \ninit\n() method, this function should be overwritten. Otherwise, it is simpler to overwrite network_type().\n\n\nexperiment\n.create_node\n(\nparticipant, network\n)\nReturn a new node associated with the \nparticipant\n and in \nnetwork\n.

See also, experiment.attention_check().\n\n\nexperiment\n.data_check_failed\n(\nparticipant\n) \n\nRuns when \nparticipant\n has failed the data_check.

However, participants will take part in experiments via an interactive web-site (the \"front-end\"). Accordingly for an experiment to proceed there must be a means of communication between the front and back ends. This is achieved with routes:\n\n\n\n\nRoutes are specific web addresses on the server that respond to requests from the front-end. Routes have direct access to the database, though most of the time they will pass requests to the experiment which will in turn access the database. As such, changing the behavior of the experiment is the easiest way to create a new experiment. However it is also possible to change the behavior of the routes or add new routes entirely.\n\n\nRequests generally come in two types: \"get\" requests, which ask for information from the database, and \"post\" requests which send new information to be added to the database. Once a request is complete the back-end sends a response back to the front-end. Minimally, this will include a notification that the request was successfully processed, but often it will also include additional information.\n\n\nAs long as requests are properly formatted and correctly addressed to routes, the back-end will send the appropriate response. This means that the front-end could take any form. For instance requests could come from a standard HTML/CSS/JS webpage, a more sophisticated web-app, or even from the experiment itself.",
