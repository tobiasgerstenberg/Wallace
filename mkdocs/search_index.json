For it to work you will need to have Python 2.7 installed. You can check what version of Python you have by running:\n\n\npython --version\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have Python 2.7 installed, you can install it from the [Python website] (https://www.python.org/downloads/). \n\n\nInstall Postgres\n\n\nWallace uses Postgres to create local databases. Install Postgres from \npostgresapp.com\n. This will require downloading a zip file, unzipping the file and installing the unzipped application. \n\n\nYou will then need to add Postgres to your PATH environmental variable. If you use the default location for installing applications on OS X (namely \n/Applications\n), you can adjust your path by running the following command:\n\n\nexport PATH=\n/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin:$PATH\n\n\n\n\n\nNB: If you have installed a more recent version of Postgres (e.g., the \nthe upcoming version 9.4\n) you may need to alter that command slightly to accommodate the more recent version number. If you need to \u2013 or want to \u2013 double check which version to include, then run:    \n\n\nls /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/\n\n\n\n\nWhatever number that returns is the version number that you should place in the \nexport\n command above. If it does not return a number, you have not installed Postgres correctly in your /Applications folder or something else is horribly wrong.\n\n\nCreate the Database\n\n\nAfter installing Postgres, you will need to create a database for your experiment to use. Run the following command from the comand line:\n\n\npsql -c 'create database wallace;' -U postgres\n\n\n\n\nInstall Wallace\n\n\nInstall Wallace from the terminal by running\n\n\npip install wallace\n\n\n\n\nTest that your installation works by running:\n\n\nwallace --version",
