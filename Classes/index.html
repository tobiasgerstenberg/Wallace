            <p>The classes involved in a Wallace experiment are: <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#network">Network</a>, <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#node">Node</a>, <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#vector">Vector</a>, <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#info">Info</a>, <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#transmission">Transmission</a>, <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#transformation">Transformation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#participant">Participant</a> and <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-cocosci/Wallace/wiki/Classes#question">Question</a>. The code for all these classes can be seen in models.py. All of the classes have a corresponding table in the database, with each instance stored as a row in the relevant table. Accordingly, each class is defined, in part, by the columns that constitute the table it is stored in. In addition, the classes have relationships to other objects and a number of functions.</p>
<p>The classes have relationships to each other as shown in the diagram below (be careful about which way the arrows point). A Node is a point in a Network that might be associated with a Participant. A Vector is a directional connection between two Nodes. An Info is a piece of information created by a Node. A Transmission is an instance of an Info being sent along a Vector. A Transformation is a relationship between two Infos. A Question is a piece of information created by a Participant.</p>

<h3 id="network">Network</h3>
<p>The Network object can be imagined as a set of other objects with some functions that perform operations over those objects. The objects that Networks have direct access to are all the Nodes in the network, the Vectors between those Nodes, Infos created by those Nodes, Transmissions sent along the Vectors by those Nodes and Transformations of those Infos. Participants and Questions do not exist within Networks. An experiment may involve multiple Networks, Transmissions can only occur within networks, not between them.</p>

In addition nodes cannot connect with themselves or with Sources. <em>Direction</em> specifies the direction of the connection it can be "to" (node -&gt; whom), "from" (whom -&gt; node) or both (node &lt;-&gt; whom).

The default value is "to", other values are "from", "both" and "either". Note that this method does not take a <em>failed</em> argument and it will only look along not failed vectors.</p>

Return a list of infos created by the node. If specified, <em>type</em> filters by class. By default failed infos are excluded, to include only failed infos use <em>failed=True</em>, for all infos use <em>failed="all"</em>.</p>
<p>node.<strong>mutate</strong>(<em>info_in</em>) <br />
Mutate the <em>info_in</em> - create a new info of the same type with its contents determined by info_in.mutated_contents() and then create a Mutation (a subclass of Transformation) linking the two.</p>
<p>node.<strong>neighbors</strong>([<em>type</em>, <em>direction</em>]) <br />
Return a list of other nodes with an immediate connection to this node. If specified, <em>type</em> filters neighboring nodes by class. <em>Direction</em> specifies the direction of the connection and can be "to", "from", "both" or "either"; the default value is "to". Note that a <em>failed</em> argument should not be passed to node.neighbors() and the function only returns not failed nodes connected by not failed vectors.</p>
<p>node.<strong>receive</strong>([<em>what</em>]) <br />
Receive incoming transmissions. <em>What</em> specifies what to receive. It can be a specific transmission. If <em>what</em> is not specified all pending transmissions are received. Received transmissions have their status set to "received" and their receive_time set to now. A list of all the infos associated with the received transmissions is passed to node.update().</p>
<p>node<strong>.received_infos</strong>([<em>type</em>]) <br />

Nodes can only transmit infos they have made and can only transmit to nodes they are connected to.</p>
<p>node.<strong>update</strong>(<em>infos</em>) <br />
Process received infos, called by node.receive(). By default this method does nothing. It is intended to be overwritten to provide subclasses of node new behaviors that occur automatically when they receive transmissions.</p>
<p>node<strong>.vectors</strong>([<em>direction</em>, <em>failed</em>]) <br />
Return a list of vectors connected to the node. Direction specfies whether to include vectors that originate from or arrive at the node. It defaults to "all", but can also be "incoming" or "outgoing".

<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p>A Question is a way to store information associated with a Participant as opposed to a Node (Infos are made by Nodes, not Participants). Questions are generally useful for storing responses debriefing questions etc.</p>
<h4 id="columns_7">Columns</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>id</em> - a unique number for every entry. 1, 2, 3 and so on...</li>
<li><em>creation_time</em> - the time at which the Question was created.</li>
<li><em>property1</em> - a generic column that can be used to store experiment specific details in String form.</li>
<li><em>property2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em> and <em>5</em> - same as above.</li>
<li><em>failed</em> - boolean indicating whether the Question has failed which prompts Wallace to ignore it unless specified otherwise. Objects are usually failed to indicate something has gone wrong.</li>
<li><em>time_of_death</em> - the time at which failing occurred.</li>
<li><em>type</em> - a String giving the name of the class. Defaults to "question". This allows subclassing.</li>
<li><em>question_id</em> - a number. E.g., each participant might complete three questions numbered 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li><em>question</em> - the text of the question.</li>
<li><em>response</em> - the participant's response. Stored as a string.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="relationships_7">Relationships</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>participant</em> - the participant who answered the question.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods_5">Methods</h4>
