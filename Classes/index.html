            <p>The classes involved in a Wallace experiment are: <a href="./#network">Network</a>, <a href="./#node">Node</a>, <a href="./#vector">Vector</a>, <a href="./#info">Info</a>, <a href="./#transmission">Transmission</a>, <a href="./#transformation">Transformation</a>, <a href="./#participant">Participant</a> and <a href="./#question">Question</a>. The code for all these classes can be seen in <code>models.py</code>. Each class has a corresponding table in the database, with each instance stored as a row in the table. Accordingly, each class is defined, in part, by the columns that constitute the table it is stored in. In addition, the classes have relationships to other objects and a number of functions.</p>
<p>The classes have relationships to each other as shown in the diagram below. Be careful to note which way the arrows point. A <code>Node</code> is a point in a <code>Network</code> that might be associated with a <code>Participant</code>. A <code>Vector</code> is a directional connection between a <code>Node</code> and another <code>Node</code>. An <code>Info</code> is information created by a <code>Node</code>. A <code>Transmission</code> is an instance of an <code>Info</code> being sent along a <code>Vector</code>. A <code>Transformation</code> is a relationship between an <code>Info</code> and another <code>Info</code>. A <code>Question</code> is a survey response created by a <code>Participant</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/class_chart.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="network">Network</h2>
<p>The <code>Network</code> object can be imagined as a set of other objects with some functions that perform operations over those objects. The objects that <code>Network</code>s have direct access to are all the <code>Node</code>s in the network, the <code>Vector</code>s between those Nodes, Infos created by those Nodes, Transmissions sent along the Vectors by those Nodes and Transformations of those Infos. Participants and Questions do not exist within Networks. An experiment may involve multiple Networks, Transmissions can only occur within networks, not between them.</p>

Return a list of infos created by the node. If specified, <code>type</code> filters by class. By default failed infos are excluded, to include only failed infos use <code>failed=True</code>, for all infos use <code>failed=all</code>.</p>
<p><code>Node.mutate(info_in)</code>
Mutate the <code>info_in</code> - create a new info of the same type with its contents determined by info_in.mutated_contents() and then create a Mutation (a subclass of Transformation) linking the two.</p>
<p><code>Node.neighbors([type, direction])</code>
Return a list of other nodes with an immediate connection to this node. If specified, <code>type</code> filters neighboring nodes by class. <code>direction</code> specifies the direction of the connection and can be "to", "from", "both" or "either"; the default value is "to". Note that a <code>failed</code> argument should not be passed to node.neighbors() and the function only returns not failed nodes connected by not failed vectors.</p>
<p><code>Node.receive([what])</code><br />
Receive incoming transmissions. <code>what</code> specifies what to receive. It can be a specific transmission. If <code>what</code> is not specified all pending transmissions are received.

Nodes can only transmit infos they have made and can only transmit to nodes they are connected to.</p>
<p><code>Node.update(infos)</code> <br />
